# Expo Camera Preview Rendering Failure

This repository demonstrates a bug in the Expo Camera API where the camera preview intermittently fails to render correctly. The preview might appear blank, or an error might be displayed, despite seemingly correct code.

## Bug Description

The issue is characterized by the unpredictable failure of the camera preview to function.  The bug is difficult to debug because of its intermittent nature. Standard debugging techniques often fail to pinpoint the root cause.

## Reproduction

Reproducing the bug is challenging due to its inconsistency.  It seems to be related to specific device configurations, camera settings, or potentially timing issues.

## Solution

The provided solution involves several strategies to mitigate the issue.  These include attempting to reset the camera, managing permissions more explicitly, and adding error handling to gracefully manage rendering failures.
