This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API with specific camera settings or device configurations.  The issue manifests as the camera preview failing to render correctly, appearing blank, or showing an error. This is often intermittent and hard to reproduce consistently. The code might seem correct, yet the camera preview remains dysfunctional.  A common root cause isn't immediately apparent in the Expo documentation or typical debugging steps.
